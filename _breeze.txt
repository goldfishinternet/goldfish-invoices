Service Providers

One of the most important kernel bootstrapping actions is loading the service providers
for your application. Service providers are responsible for bootstrapping all of the
framework's various components, such as the database, queue, validation, and routing
components. All of the service providers for the application are configured in the
config/app.php configuration file's providers array.
